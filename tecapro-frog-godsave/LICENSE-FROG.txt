(*
Pascal reference implementation for the FROG symmetric block cipher
submitted by TecApro to NIST as an AES candidate algorithm. This
implementation of FROG is more flexible than the C and Java reference
implementations submitted, because it permits the use of any block size
between 8 bytes and 128 bytes.

The full FROG documentation can be found in www.tecapro.com

This code was written by Dianelos Georgoudis (email: dianelos@tecapro.com)
in June 1998.

This source code has three parts:

A. Definition of the pure FROG algorithm.

B. Implementation of the NIST specified API, including ECB, CBC,
   and CFB 1-bit modes.

C. Examples of use in ECB, CBC and CFB mode as well as code for the creation
   of the Known Answer Tests and the Monte Carlo Tests, as specified by NIST.

This algorithm is put in the public domain.
