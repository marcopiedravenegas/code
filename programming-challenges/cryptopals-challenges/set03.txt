Challenges  Set 3
Crypto Challenge Set 3
This is the next set of block cipher cryptography challenges (even the randomness stuff here plays into block cipher crypto).

This set is moderately difficult. It includes a famous attack against CBC mode, and a "cloning" attack on a popular RNG that can be annoying to get right.

We've also reached a point in the crypto challenges where all the challenges, with one possible exception, are valuable in breaking real-world crypto.

The CBC padding oracle
Implement CTR, the stream cipher mode
Break fixed-nonce CTR mode using substitutions
Break fixed-nonce CTR statistically
Implement the MT19937 Mersenne Twister RNG
Crack an MT19937 seed
Clone an MT19937 RNG from its output
Create the MT19937 stream cipher and break it
