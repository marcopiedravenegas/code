the cryptopals crypto challenges
Challenges  Set 4
Crypto Challenge Set 4
This is the last set of block cipher cryptography challenges, and also our coverage of message authentication.

This set is much easier than the last set. We introduce some new concepts, but the attacks themselves involve less code than, say, the CBC padding oracle.

Things get significantly trickier in the next two sets. A lot of people drop off after set 4.

Break "random access read/write" AES CTR
CTR bitflipping
Recover the key from CBC with IV=Key
Implement a SHA-1 keyed MAC
Break a SHA-1 keyed MAC using length extension
Break an MD4 keyed MAC using length extension
Implement and break HMAC-SHA1 with an artificial timing leak
Break HMAC-SHA1 with a slightly less artificial timing leak
