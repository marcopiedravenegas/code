It just dawned on me: game-theoretical continuous models of computation.

What if we had a computational manifold (i.e., a high-dimensional surface where computations take place) that fought against and collaborated with itself?

Decisions of agents in a game (even an infinite noncountable game with infinite noncountable agents, say, numbers in Rn as game-theoretical agents) are computations. Effects of decisions are computations.

Then bring everything together in a single computational object.
