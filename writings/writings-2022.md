# Writings from 2022

I figured it out: I sabotage my learning and development because of an utter fear of my creations taking control over me.

For instance, writing code with intrinsic flaws that becomes hard to fix before a deadline. Deadlines are deadly to me.

It's as if I were anticipating to fear-triggering events and avoiding them altogether, instead of making progress, albeit with flaws.

I can't consider myself a perfectionist. I'm more than used to doing thing sloppily, not delivering or delivering middle-of-the-road results,
dropping projects and courses (that's the official reason of me still being an undergrad, over a decade and a half since I started my CS degree).

Long ago, I let fear take control over my life. Fear of me witnessing, in reality, the mediocre I actually am.

I was picking up Jacobson's "Basic Algebra I"

https://www.maa.org/publications/maa-reviews/basic-algebra-i-0

While it's purportedly a tough reading (abstract algebra might be as hostile as The Hiss in "Control"),
it's what I need for a solid foundations towards cryptography and computational number theory.

Indeed, the mathematical background for implementing cryptographic schemes is
far less demanding than a full-fledged approach (groups, rings, fields, modules, categories).

Still, I know I want to learn higher/abstract algebra. Even when I left the math major.
Even when I know I would make a particularly lousy cryptographer :/

Mathematics has always been my stronghold, in the sense that it's the ultimate
proxy to confront myself against myself.

Being this bad at math has always been my core source of fears and insecurities.

I never ever hated math, even since elementary school.
I am absolutely convinced that mathematics **is** too important.

Computing is interesting, and writing software that works well is useful to everyone.
But this mirror called mathematics is powerful beyond comprehension.

If any one thing is important to me in this life, it's making sense of mathematical constructions,
being able to write correct, sound, coherent non-trivial proofs, solving theoretical and applied math problems,
modeling phenomena to study them.

Failing at that, time and again and in various guises, has always created an utterly deep existential anguish in me.
It's indeed the case that I always sabotage my own learning, in order to always have a chance to attack myself.

Mathematics is my ultimate judge. There's no escape from it. Not even computing.

;)

I **do** like this series.

While it's fiction, Mr Robot is a most accurate depiction of modern cybersecurity (2010s).

For some reason, I delayed watching it for years. In general, I hardly watch TV or series.

I prefer the timelessness of text, the malleability of the written language. Every sufficiently sophisticated
civilization in history developed their writing system, after centuries of solely oral tradition.

They started using writing for what really mattered to them.
Most of what we know about them survived as texts in long-term writing media
(papyrus, parchment, stone, clay).

Now we exist in text, even for the most trivial of human actions,
potentially for posterity (provided the media survives).

In the grand scheme of things, entire lives were lived for articulating ideas
and observations into specific words at specific places, times, and circumstances of History.
And making these words persistent for the future.

What part of my writings will still be read, understood, thought about
by sentient beings in the next centuries or millennia?

Most probably, not a single thing I've ever written will be relevant enough
to be read in the very long term. Like the large majority of content produced nowadays.

When writing for the sake of writing, we delude ourselves into thinking our
ideas are important enough to be rendered timeless.

Caf√© con sal (Alriode)

http://web.archive.org/web/20091219225442/http://alriode.wordpress.com/cafe-con-sal/

That was me writing in Spanish, back then in 2009.

`alriode` used to be my handle/username on the web between 2006 and 2014.
My more recent handle is `mpiedrav`.

For anyone out there doing fingerprinting/OSINT about me ;)

I frequently Google myself, to check how much information is lingering around
about me. In the sense of what kind of social engineering could be performed on
me.

(Mr Robot is an absolute showcase of practical, realistic social engineering,
beside software and hardware hacks.)

For instance, There's a picture I found featuring Tim Berners-Lee and Vint Cerf.

From the W3C20 Anniversary Symposium, "The Future of the Web".

I also used to manage Drupal and Wordpress sites in the late 2000s.
I **really** expect those installations have been patched ever since :/

Better yet, using a static site generator like Jekyll and offloading dynamic
content to Google Forms and other services.

I started watching Mr Robot. Seems like a reasonably good series.

I often think about potential plot twists, so I supposed that Mr Robot was working for Evil Corp. In the sense of there only being evil, crushing any attempt to being destroyed by seizing and disabling the ways to its own destruction. An all-mighty evil, often disguised as apparent "goodness", and no true goodness (kind of what I think about the real world). Seems more traditionally polar, good-vs-bad than that.

Finally, I'm making sense of the producer-consumer pattern in concurrent programming. Conceptually and behaviorally, it's relatively easy to understand. But putting it to use to solve problems was more challenging than I supposed.

There's an insurmountable schism between the ethereal ideas of how a computing concept works and actual realizations in executable code. It's the ever-standing difference between theory and practice.

In 2009, I switched majors from computer science to pure math. Even when my performance in math is considerably lackluster, even mediocre. Still, I wanted to get acquainted with its core ideas. Didn't make it far, however. Still, I don't regret all the years I "wasted" in pure mathematics.

Then I started working at IT companies, and got back to computer science in 2020. It's just astonishingly beautiful how mathematical concepts are materialized in executable programs. Materialized, because running software is physical phenomena in the end.

The proof is in the running program.
