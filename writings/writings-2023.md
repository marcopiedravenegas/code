It's indeed possible to have a moral imperative to try to improve things in my country, my area of study, etc., even when I hate my country, my area of study, etc.

Just like many people out there, I've fantasized about terrorist attacks obliterating the president, every congressperson, every chief judge, every minister, every higher bureaucrat at every institution in my country. That's legally considered conspiracy to commit higher treason. But I just don't believe in the idea of a nation or an institution.

Still, executing violence is pointless and ineffective. Terrorism is an imbecile nonsolution to problems that just don't have any solution. It's a problem on top of existing problems. It only makes things worse.

Constructive approaches, like building and maintaining institutions, only perpetuate their inherent evil and corruption. Still, the destructive alternative doesn't lead anywhere either.

Physical existence is hell on Earth. It can only become worse. The net sum of evil in any period of History never changes. Human evil, like energy, only transforms. It never gets destroyed.

I'm beyond disgusted about my own existence. I only long for my death. The mere idea of a deity to be thankful for being alive is absolutely meaningless to me. Human existence is an aberration of nature. My existence in particular is an accident that should never have happened.

I just can't find anything in life worth living for, worth not wanting to die. For me, life can only get worse from the current state of affairs. I can only become more delusional and depressive and suicidal and violent and misanthropic. I can never ever improve as a person.

The one and only final solution for me is to die as soon as possible, as fast as possible.

As a species, we only deserve to die en masse, to stop existing altogether. We deserve a cataclismic event that obliterates all human life. Wars and pandemics are mere killings. We need the total genocide of all humans.

We only know to propagate Evil, generation after generation, offspring after offspring. Children learn Evil from their parents. Some of them become, in turn, parents who teach Evil.

There's no redemption nor salvation at all. There's only human Evil in all of its forms. As power over others, as "goodness" upon others, as "collaboration" with others, as individualism away from others.

We as a species are a plague, a cancer, a virus, a predator, pollution, contamination in this planet. The one and only solution is the erradication of all of humanity. Not by race or ethnic group or class or nation or any other criteria, but all at once, no one left behind.

The pressure to produce faster and cheaper is an absolute normal in the software industry.
Students are taught about good design principles, only to have to unlearn everything at the job.

To me, every human endeavor is a mirror of the inherent Evil in each and every human, me and everyone else. It might not seem like it, but there's Evil in everything.
Human existence itself is Evil itself. The end of the human species wouldn't be a tragedy to me. At least the rest of species on the planet could regenerate after that event.

I don't believe in Heaven, as an ethereal realm. I only believe there's a personalized, customized Hell inside each and every one of us. Each person is their own Devil.
And no, there's no God, as in universal goodness. There's only universal Evil in all its forms.

I still wonder how long will I restrain myself from killing myself. It's only a matter of time. Perhaps a few years or less.

Depression has destroyed me, has made me an empty shell of a person. No treatment has ever worked to me. My own means of self-destruction are deeply ingrained inside myself.
I'm a bomb that cannot be defused. I just want to explode without harming anyone, on some barren land in controlled conditions.

Voluntary euthanasia should be available for free, without any legal strings attached. The less humans in this realm of existence, the better.

I've been having persistent ideas of suicide for years. I visualize myself slitting my own throat and cutting my stomach open
with the kitchen knife at midnight, on my bed. It'll be a mess to clean in the morning, but that would be the final solution.

There's nothing in this world I can live for. No significant other. No close friendship with anyone. No future or projects worth living.

I only perceive latent hostility, giant egos, threatening atmospheres. Coding is fun, but not as a social activity.
I never fit in society anyway. I never really had fun being with other people. I fear myself, let alone others.

In June, I'll be 37. I feel totally alienated, as an old undergraduate student among people 15 years younger than me.
I've dropped computer science and mathematics courses time and again due to anxiety.
On the one hand, it was a wrong decision every time, delaying my graduation ever more.
On the other hand, when I feel deep anxiety, I want to reach for the kitchen knife.
And slit my throat in front of my parents and brother at daylight. And have my final solution.

In fact, I tried killing myself in September 2005. But I just cut myself on my arms. I carry the visible scars.

I was in a psychiatric hospital for about 10 days. I slept a lot. There was silence, mostly. Every patient on their bed.
I had to take clonazepam and fluoxetine. My sleeping cycles were destroyed forever because of clonazepam, a sedative.

I guess I'll survive my next suicide attempt and will have to be taken to the psychiatric hospital yet again. For even longer.
Perhaps months.

I want my final solution to be prompt and final. No delays.
