I still remember a dream, from a few years ago, about a theoretical computer science conference.

It took place in the evening, at a building that resembled the Bell Labs facility in Murray Hill, NJ, but on a smaller scale. However, I wasn't sure what country it was.

In the dream, I was checking the conference program during a break.

Meanwhile, Oded Goldreich and others were preparing for their presentations.

I was a technical assistant, not a speaker or guest. I felt totally out of place.
