It's my 4th year in my CS BSc degree, I'm 38, and I just can't reason correctly and clearly.

In my CS research course, prof can't make heads or tails about my research (ridehailing pricing simulation).

Now I'm convinced I'm not meant to do research in computer science.

A scientist is expected to be crystal-clear and precise about their ideas.

My generalized anxiety disorder, clinical depression, and Asperger's disorder have been hindering me time and again.

I'm not even sure why I still live. I'm particularly useless and unstable for life to make sense to me at all.

I keep moving by momentum or inertia. But I know I'll eventually kill myself by stabbing.

I tried cutting my wrists in August-September 2005. That's where the scars along my arms come from.
